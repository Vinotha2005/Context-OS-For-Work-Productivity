# Raw Journal :
Sir, I want to share something honestly about how I am feeling these days.
I really wish to become my old self again — the version of me who had interest and involvement in everything. But right now, I’m struggling a lot with concentration. When I’m given a task, instead of spending time understanding it properly or learning from it, my mind only focuses on finishing it quickly and taking rest. Because of this, I feel mentally and physically exhausted most of the time and keep thinking about when I’ll be free.
For the past one month, I haven’t really spent much time with anyone. I also realize that I’m careless in many situations. I can easily build trust with people, and even if they hurt me, I know how to keep them close. But I find it very difficult to maintain relationships smoothly. I don’t spend enough time, and when people become close to me, I’m unable to meet their expectations.
Even today, my friend Anusiya kept calling me for almost three days, and I cut the call. I’m not able to talk with interest or be emotionally present. I know that I don’t value people the same way they value me, and I’m aware of this. I want to change, and I am trying, but I’m not able to do it immediately.
Right now, I feel extremely tired. I strongly feel that I need at least two complete days of proper sleep, fresh air, and mental space — staying away from mobile and laptop — just to feel normal again without any worries.
I know I’m careless about many things. Some things feel very easy to me, so I don’t value them much, but others value them highly, which sometimes creates clashes. At the same time, I get depressed in many situations. But one thing I want to clearly say is that I will never give up on my studies.
I wanted to share this so you can understand my current situation.
