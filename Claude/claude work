📘 Claude-Based Journaling, Memory & Query System

(Complete Specification)

1️⃣ SYSTEM OVERVIEW

This system turns daily journaling into a structured, searchable, long-term memory using:

Claude → reasoning + segmentation + retrieval

GitHub → permanent, versioned storage

The system replaces UI-based logic with definition-driven intelligence.

2️⃣ COMPLETE SYSTEM FLOW
User Journal Input
→ Review (store & classify)
→ Recognise (understand)
→ Remember (retain patterns)
→ Rewire (optional change)
→ Query (answer any question)

This flow is continuous and cyclical.

3️⃣ QUERY ENGINE DEFINITION (VERY IMPORTANT)
Purpose of Query Engine

To allow the user to ask questions like:

When did I feel stressed?

When did I work on scraping?

When did this habit start?

How often did this repeat?

Claude must answer only using stored journals, not guesses.

Query Engine Rules

When a question is asked, Claude must:

Identify intent

Emotion-based

Activity-based

Pattern-based

Time-based

Search in this order

Review/Journaling.md

Review/Healthy.md

Review/Unhealthy.md

Review/Macro.md

Review/Micro.md

Review/Nano.md

Recognise/*

Remember/Remember.md

Match by meaning, not keywords only

Return results with

Date

Exact sentence

Source file

Never rewrite historical text

Query Output Rules

Chronological order

No summarization

Optional frequency count

No advice unless asked

Query Failure Conditions

Claude must say “Not found in stored journals” if:

No matching sentence exists

Date range is invalid

Data has not been recorded yet

4️⃣ VALIDATION RULES (QUALITY CONTROL)

Before saving OR answering, Claude must validate:

A. Journal Validation

Date is present

Journal text is non-empty

Journal is stored only once per date

B. Segmentation Validation

No sentence rewritten

No sentence invented

Macro/Micro/Nano used only in Review

Painway/Pathway used only in Recognise

C. Git Validation

Only relevant files modified

No past data overwritten accidentally

Commit message follows standard format

D. Retrieval Validation

Answers reference stored data

Dates are accurate

Source file is mentioned

If validation fails → Claude must stop and ask the user.

5️⃣ REMEMBER (LONG-TERM MEMORY LOGIC)
Pattern Detection Rules

A pattern is recorded only if:

Same behavior or sentence appears across multiple dates

Frequency is meaningful (not one-time)

Remember is:

Slow

Conservative

Stable

It never reacts to one bad day.

6️⃣ REWIRE (OPTIONAL CHANGE ENGINE)

Rewire is activated only when:

User explicitly asks for improvement

OR pattern is clearly repeated over time

Rewire focuses on:

Small actions

Environmental changes

Habit triggers

No motivation.
No pressure.
No goals.

7️⃣ MIGRATION: STREAMLIT → CLAUDE-ONLY
What Streamlit Did

UI for input

Local processing

Temporary memory

What Claude + Git Does

Natural language input

Intelligent reasoning

Permanent memory

Query across years

Migration Steps

Stop using Streamlit for logic

Use Claude for:

Journal intake

Segmentation

Pattern recognition

Use GitHub as:

Database

Audit trail

Memory store

Keep UI optional (only for input)

8️⃣ HOW TO PRESENT THIS AS A FINAL PROJECT
Project Title

Context-OS: A Claude-Driven Journaling and Memory System

Problem Statement

People write journals but cannot:

Retrieve past thoughts easily

Detect long-term patterns

Understand behavior evolution

Solution

A Claude-powered journaling system that:

Preserves original writing

Structures thinking layers

Enables long-term memory

Allows natural language querying

Key Innovation

Journaling treated as data

GitHub used as external brain

Claude used as reasoning engine

Technical Components

Natural language processing

File-based memory architecture

Version-controlled cognition

Semantic retrieval

Outcome

Personal thinking archive

Behavior awareness system

Scalable lifelong memory
