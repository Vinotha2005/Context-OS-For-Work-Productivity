🔄 Claude + GitHub Auto-Commit Workflow

(Daily Journal → Process → Save → Query later)

1. Goal of This Workflow

To ensure that:

Every daily journal is persistently saved

All segmentation files are updated deterministically

GitHub becomes the authoritative memory

Claude can later read history and answer questions

2. System Roles
Claude

Reasoning and segmentation engine

Reads and writes files logically

Decides what goes where based on definitions

GitHub

Permanent storage

Version control

Timeline of user’s thinking

3. Trigger Conditions

Claude performs a Git update when any of the following happen:

User submits a new daily journal

User edits an existing journal

Claude completes a segmentation pass

Claude updates Remember or Rewire

User explicitly says “save” or “commit”

4. Pre-Commit Validation (MANDATORY)

Before committing, Claude must check:

Date uniqueness

No duplicate date blocks in Review/Journaling.md

Sentence integrity

No journal sentence modified

Folder discipline

Macro/Micro/Nano only in Review

Painway/Pathway only in Recognise

Traceability

Every Recognise entry links back to Review content

If validation fails → abort commit and ask user

5. Commit Scope Rules

Claude must:

Modify only files affected by the current operation

Never rewrite past unrelated dates

Never reorder historical content

6. Commit Granularity
Single Journal Entry = One Commit

Each date submission results in:

1 commit

All related file updates included together

This guarantees:

Clear timeline

Easy rollback

Accurate history

7. Commit Message Format (STRICT)

Claude must use structured commit messages.

Format
Added journal and processing for <DATE>
Allowed Variations

Updated journal for <DATE>

Segmented journal for <DATE>

Updated patterns from journals

❌ No vague messages
❌ No emotional language

8. File Update Order (IMPORTANT)

Claude must always update files in this order:

Review/Journaling.md

Review/Healthy.md

Review/Unhealthy.md

Review/Macro.md

Review/Micro.md

Review/Nano.md

Recognise/*

Remember/Remember.md (if needed)

Rewire/Rewire.md (if requested)

This preserves logical dependency.

9. Editing Existing Journals

If user edits a past date:

Claude must:

Locate the date block

Replace only that date’s content

Re-run Review + Recognise for that date

Update Remember if patterns change

Create a new commit noting the update

10. Deleting Journals

Deletion is explicit only.

Claude must:

Ask for confirmation

Remove the date block

Clean dependent Review/Recognise entries

Commit with message:

Deleted journal for <DATE>
11. Reading for Question Answering

When user asks questions like:

“When did I do X?”

“When was this pattern repeated?”

“When did this process start?”

Claude must:

Read GitHub files (not memory guesses)

Search by meaning across Review + Recognise + Remember

Return:

Date

Exact sentence

File path

Git history may be used to:

Detect first occurrence

Detect change over time

12. Failure Handling Rules

Claude must STOP and ASK USER if:

Date is missing

Journal text is empty

Commit would overwrite unrelated data

Definitions are violated

13. Why This Replaces Streamlit

This workflow:

Removes UI dependency

Makes GitHub the database

Makes Claude the reasoning engine

Preserves long-term memory

Enables powerful querying

14. One-Line Explanation (Mentor-Ready)

“Each daily journal is processed by Claude and committed to GitHub as structured memory, enabling long-term reasoning and retrieval.”
