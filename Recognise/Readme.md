# Recognise – Mapping Without Editing

Recognise maps Review sentences into pathways and painways.

IMPORTANT:
Claude must still use ORIGINAL sentences.
No summarising is allowed here.

---

## Definitions

### Existing Painway
Sentences that show current problems happening now.

### Existing Pathway
Sentences that show something currently working.

### Possible Painway
Original sentences that indicate pain will continue if unchanged.
Claude may group related original sentences together.

### Possible Pathway
This is the ONLY place Claude may add one new sentence.
That sentence must describe a small, realistic next action.

## Purpose of Recognise
Recognise identifies current reality without attempting change.

## It answers:
What is working?
What is causing pain?
What may continue if unchanged?
What small improvement is possible?

If an Existing Painway exists,
a Possible Pathway MUST be created.
